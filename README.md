## Basic Overview

### Context

From Ocean's 11:

"The house always wins. Play long enough, you never change the stakes, the house takes you. Unless, when that perfect hand comes along, you bet big, and then you take the house."

For anyone who has played sports gambling in their lives, they know one thing: it is incredibly difficult to beat the house. Even if you pick winners more than 50.1% of the time, you will still lose money in the long run.

### Goal

Develop an NFL game predictor that predicts which team will win the game. The model explores the important features of making the prediction.
